Todo:

- use experimental version with "efficient" src/bin/test.ml
  datastructures
- export results 
- combine with a p1-like action phase
- integrate with p1_extra/parsing_dsl2
- for performance, combine earley with top-down recursive parsing of
  block structure
- test.ml: use a hashmap to hashset for implementation of sets of items
- think about using eg roaring bitsets/maps for efficient
  implementation of sets of integers
