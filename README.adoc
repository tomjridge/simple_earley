== Meta

On github, to preview the documented code, try http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/tomjridge/simple_earley/blob/master/src/simple_earley.html


== Building

To build the code, you need the nix package manager: https://nixos.org/nix/

Then, in the project root directory, type: `nix-shell` to drop to a
bash shell with all the dependencies installed. Then type `make`. You
should end up with various executables that you can run (the files
ending `.native`).
