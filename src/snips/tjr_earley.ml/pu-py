       l=|input|, including any complete items; if we have a complete
       item X -> i,as S,j,[] then we know it arose from a blocked item
       X -> i,as,k,S and a complete item (k,S,j); FIXME so when
       cutting items we at least need to record a map from (S,j) ->
       k 

       We could also just retain the todo_done(k) sets, since these
       detail all (complete) items, but then we would have to process
       these sets which might be expensive. *)
