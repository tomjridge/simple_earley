** Meta

On github, to preview the documented code, try http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/tomjridge/simple_earley/blob/master/src/tjr_earley.html


** Building

To build, type ~make~


** Opam

This is not really intended to be installed as a library. However, in
order to advertise the existence of this code, there needs to be an
entry in the opam packages list. So this package does exist in Opam,
but nothing is installed - the code just gets built.

To see the results of the build, invoke e.g.:

----
opam install -vvv --keep-build-dir tjr_earley 
----

Then you should be able to locate the executables ~test.native~ and
~simple_test.native~
